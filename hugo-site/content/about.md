## About Forge Workout

Forge Workout is an MVP workout planner and logger built for **DNA Sports Center** in Milford, Ohio. DNA trains athletes of all ages—from 8-year-olds to D1 collegiate athletes—and needed a tool tailored to their workflow.

### The Problem

The existing application (TeamBuilder) lacked features critical to DNA's training model:

- No embedded tutorial videos
- No recurring workout patterns
- No automatic phase-aware progression

### The Solution

Forge Workout delivers:

- **Workout logging** — athletes record sets, reps, and weights that persist to the backend.
- **Recurring scheduling** — trainers define repeatable patterns and the system auto-generates plans.
- **Template management** — reusable workout templates speed up plan creation.
- **Video embedding** — instructional videos can be linked to exercises.

### Technology Stack

- Flutter (cross-platform frontend)
- PocketBase (lightweight backend with SQLite)
- Hugo (static documentation site)
